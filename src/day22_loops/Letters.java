        ask the user to guess a number
        based on the guess tell them a message:
        if they guess higher than the number:
        too high
        if they guess lower than the number:
        too low
        if they guess the number:
        you guessed correctly
                -> this will stop the guessing flow

        Challenge: keep track of the number of attempts taken to guess right*/
